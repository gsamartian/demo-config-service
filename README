Purpose
********

Demo Spring cloud Config based Config Service to highlight
the issue when having a folder/serviceId prefixed with application.

When fetching the configuraiton via the config server, any serviceId/folder which has "application" prefixed is skipped.

This means, the public/global application.yml and application-<env>.yml are skipped and only the service specific config is fetched.

I am not sure if the standard is to not name serviceId starting with "application" or if it is bug with config server.

So, I created this repo to demonstrate the issue.

The logs obtained when accessing are available in logs.txt file.
